    "response": "Based on the provided document excerpts, here are the ordinances related to transportation and tricycles:\n\n1.  **Ordinance No. 2025-056** (Enacted August 5, 2025):\n    *   This ordinance further amends certain sections of Article XXV of Ordinance No. 93-049 (\"The Transport and Traffic Code of Naga City\"), as amended by Ordinance No. 2022-046, and repeals Ordinance No. 2025-023.\n    *   It establishes a unified route for a total of **Thirty (30) units of Special Trimobile Franchises** for the consolidated VISTODA and LAVISTODA Associations. This includes 10 units for VISTODA, 10 for LAVISTODA, and an additional 10 units.\n    *   **Approved Route:** From Langon to Ateneo de Naga University via Vistansa Subdivision and to Centro Cararayan up to the corner of San Miguel Street and Tecla San Andres-Ziga Road (San-Isidro-Cararayan Road) via Sitio Salunguigui, and vice versa. There is a **strict prohibition from entering Tecla San Andres-Ziga Road.**\n    *   The 30 franchises are to be equally divided among qualified applicants from Barangay Pacol (Deca Vistansa) and Barangay Cararayan.\n    *   Designated waiting stations are the existing authorized waiting area in Deca Vistansa for Pacol-based units, and Cararayan Proper for Cararayan-based units. Both VISTODA and LAVISTODA units are allowed to join the queue.\n    *   Associations are encouraged to unify under a single operational agreement, commit to self-regulation, discipline, and compliance with City Government policies.\n    *   The Trimobile Task Force, in coordination with the Public Safety Office (PSO) and concerned Barangay Councils, is responsible for implementation.\n\n2.  **Ordinance No. 2025-067** (Enacted September 9, 2025):\n    *   This ordinance further amends certain sections of Article XXV of Ordinance No. 93-049 (\"The Transport and Traffic Code of Naga City\"), Ordinance No. 2022-046, and **Ordinance No. 2025-056.**\n    *   Its primary purpose is to **increase the approved Route Measure Capacity (RMC) from Thirty (30) to Thirty-Three (33) units of Special Trimobile Franchises** for the consolidated VISTODA and LAVISTODA Associations, adding three (3) units.\n    *   The approved route described is identical to that in Ordinance No. 2025-056.\n    *   The division of franchises (equally among applicants from Barangay Pacol and Cararayan), encouragement for associations to unify, and designated waiting stations (Deca Vistansa and Cararayan Proper) remain the same as in Ordinance No. 2025-056.\n    *   The Trimobile Task Force, PSO, and Barangay Councils are tasked with ensuring proper implementation.\n\n3.  **Ordinance No. 2025-070** (Enacted September 23, 2025):\n    *   This ordinance, titled \"Naga City Public Transport Route Rationalization Ordinance of 2025,\" institutionalizes the approved Local Public Transport Route Plan (LPTRP) for **Public Utility Jeepney (PUJ) Class 2 units**. It approves 8 routes with a total allocation of 282 PUJ Class 2 units.\n    *   While primarily focused on jeepneys, its **Section 9 (Repealing Clause)** states that \"All ordinances, resolutions, and issuances inconsistent herewith, including provisions of the Transport and Traffic Code of Naga City that conflict with the LPTRP as approved, are hereby repealed or amended accordingly.\" This indicates that general transport and traffic regulations, including those potentially affecting tricycles as part of the broader \"Transport and Traffic Code of Naga City\" (Ordinance No. 93-049), may be modified if they conflict with the LPTRP for PUJs.\n\nThe documents provided do not contain enough information to detail the specific content of Ordinance No. 93-049 (\"The Transport and Traffic Code of Naga City\"), Ordinance No. 2022-046, or Ordinance No. 2025-023, beyond their titles and how they are amended or repealed by the more recent ordinances concerning trimobile franchises.",

Its primary purpose is to provide a loan facility and financial and institutional assistance to enable students who were forced to stop their schooling due to unpaid tuition and other school fees to re-enroll and complete their courses.\n\nThe program also aims to help these students once they are back in the educational system by assisting them in migrating to available scholarship programs or in gaining admission to government schools, colleges, and training centers to enjoy free tertiary education.\n\nThe Balik Eskwela Program has four main components:\n*   Bridge Loan Facility\n*   Enrolment Re-entry Grant\n*   Semestral Financial Assistance\n*   Assistance in Migrating to a Regular Scholarship Program or to a State or Local University or College or to a government technical/vocational training center.\n\nIf a beneficiary fails to qualify for a scholarship or is not admitted to a government school, they will continue to receive financial assistance under Section 4 of Ordinance No. 2022-109, also known as the \"Educational Assistance of Naga City Ordinance,\" subject to its limitations (Document 3, SECTION 2; Document 4, SECTION 23). This program builds upon previous commitments to education, including Ordinance No. 2015-012 (Education Code of Naga City) and Ordinance No. 2012-035 (Naga City Youth Code) (Document 3, Explanatory Note).",

Quality Assurance and Defect Rectification (Naga City Bantay Proyekto Ordinance of 2025 - Ordinance No. 2025-061):**\n*   **Policy:** To ensure all government infrastructure projects are of the highest quality, conform to plans and specifications, and to compel rectification of identified defects during construction and after completion while under warranty (Section 2).\n*   **Inspections:** The Project Monitoring Committee (PMC) must regularly inspect and evaluate projects at least twice while ongoing (unannounced) and at least once a year during the Defects Liability Period (DLP) and Warranty Period (Section 4).\n*   **Reporting:** The PMC prepares an Inspection and Evaluation Report within three (3) working days after an inspection, documenting findings with evidence and recommendations (Section 5c).\n*   **Action on On-Going Projects:** If substandard materials or methods are found, affected portions must be reworked or replaced. Failure to do so can lead to suspension of payment, with the City Mayor's approval after a meeting (Section 6).\n*   **Action on Completed Projects (within DLP):** If defects are found, the CEO notifies the contractor within five (5) working days to rectify them at their expense within fifteen (15) working days. Failure to undertake repairs or perform them satisfactorily will lead to forfeiture of Performance/Warranty Security, attachment/garnishment proceedings, and blacklisting (Section 7).\n*   **Action on Completed Projects (within Warranty Period for structural defects):** The CEO notifies the contractor within five (5) working days. Responsibility for structural defects is determined through a joint inspection, and the City Legal Officer may recommend forfeiture of the Warranty Security if the contractor fails to explain satisfactorily or rectify the project. The city government may undertake repairs, with costs reimbursable by the responsible party (Section 8).\n*   **Warranty Security:** Contractors must renew their Warranty Security annually until the end of the project's warranty period. Failure to renew bars the contractor from participating in city government procurement (Section 9).\n*   **Public Participation:** The public is encouraged to report observed defects via an online platform, and the PMC must promptly act on actionable reports (Section 10).\n*   **Project Transparency Board:** Contractors must post a billboard at the project site displaying project information (name, location, contractor, dates, cost, fund source, implementing office). Failure to display a compliant billboard results in an administrative fine of P1,000.00 per day (Section 12).\n\n**2. Disposal of Excess Soil and Concrete Debris (Ordinance No. 2025-060):**\n*   **Policy:** Excess soil and concrete debris from public infrastructure projects must be delivered to designated city or barangay properties for public benefit and may not be appropriated for private use (Section 1).\n*   **Contractor Obligations:** Contractors must deliver excess soil and/or concrete debris to the nearest designated default site (old dump site in Bgy. Balatas, sanitary landfill in Bgy. San Isidro, or city property along Almeda Highway) and inform the CEO and PMC at least one day in advance of delivery (Section 4, Section 2c).\n*   **CEO Obligations:** The City Engineer's Office (CEO) estimates the probable volume of excess materials, reconciles estimates with DPWH, manages stockpiles at disposal sites, includes hauling costs in locally funded projects, and issues notices to comply for non-delivery (Section 5).\n*   **PMC Obligations:** The PMC monitors the progress of work and the delivery of excess materials, issuing a PMC Certification upon project completion detailing estimated and actual volumes delivered, with an allowable 10% variance (Section 6a, 6b, 6e, 6f).\n*   **Project Acceptance and Payment:** Acceptance of the project is contingent on the delivery of excess materials as evidenced by a PMC Certification and/or settlement of any penalty. Non-compliance bars project acceptance and processing of payment (Section 10).\n*   **Penalties:** Fines are imposed for undelivered excess soil (P1,500 for the first 3 cubic meters, P1,000 for each succeeding) and concrete debris (P1,000 for initial non-delivery and each succeeding cubic meter). Delivery or sale of excess materials to private entities is penalized with a P5,000.00 fine and potential charges for theft. Contractors found guilty are barred from city government procurement until fines are settled (Section 11).\n*   **Inclusion in Contract:** The provisions of this ordinance are deemed written into the contract of city government-funded infrastructure projects (Section 12).",
